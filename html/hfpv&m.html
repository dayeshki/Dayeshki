                            Hufflepuff is the most inclusive of the four houses, and its members are known for being hard-working, friendly, loyal, honest, and impartial. 
                            Hufflepuff values hard work, patience, justice, and loyalty. Hufflepuff's mascot is a badger, and the Head of House is Pomona Sprout. Rowling said that Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of earth.
                            Students belonging to this house are known to be hard-working, friendly, loyal, honest and rather impartial. It may be that due to their values, Hufflepuffs are not as competitive as the other houses, and are more modest about their accomplishments. Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play.he Hufflepuff house might not be notorious, or treated as though it is relevant, but this perception is terribly askew. While there are movers and shakers in the world, the true power lies with those who keep things running.
                            Not only are Hufflepuffs hard working, valuable contributors to society, they're the absolute structure of one. The people behind the scenes seem to never get the recognition that they deserve, but that is actually what makes them important. A Hufflepuff personality is focused upon fine details and order, they have no use for fame, or proving themselves deserving of any of this.None of the above means that they're not notable, however. The individual has aspirations and goals, so certainly Hufflepuffs will, too. Perhaps a Hufflepuff didn't invent the wheel, but you can be assured they figured out every possible adjustment to enhance its performance and usefulness.   <h3>
